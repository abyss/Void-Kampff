            Voight-Kampff is a bot for playing **Inhuman Conditions.**

            **Inhuman Conditions** is a five-minute, two-player game of surreal \
            interrogation and conversational judo, set in the heart of a \
            chilling bureaucracy.

            Each game has one Investigator and one Suspect. Armed only with \
            two stamps and a topic of conversation, the Investigator must \
            figure out whether the Suspect is a Human or a Robot.

            Robots must answer the Investigator's questions without arousing \
            suspicion, but are hampered by some specific malfunction in their \
            ability to converse. They must be clever, guiding the conversation \
            in subtle ways without getting caught.

            Humans may speak freely, but may find this freedom as much curse \
            as gift. There are no right or wrong answers, only suspicious and \
            innocuous ones, and one slip of the tongue could land Humans and \
            Robots alike in the Bureau's Invasive Confirmation Unit. There, \
            alongside Investigators who make improper determinations, they \
            will await further testing...

            **Inhuman Conditions** is designed by Tommy Maranges and Cory \
            O'Brien and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert.
