            Investigator, do the following:
            **1.** Ask the Subject to state their name and background.
            **2.** Ask the Subject to calibrate the penalty by performing it three times.
            **3.** Read the introduction card that was sent along with the prompts aloud.
            **4.** When both players are ready, start the timer and the investigation.

            stop the timer and send them to the Invasive Confirmation Unit for \
            further testing.
            **-** At the end of the timer, **ask one final question.** After \
            their answer, stamp the Subject **HUMAN** or **ROBOT**.
            **-** Be wary; sending a human to the Invasive Confirmation Unit will \
            result in harsh discipline. We accept only the best investigators!
